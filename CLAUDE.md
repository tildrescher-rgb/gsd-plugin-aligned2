## Session Continuity

If `.planning/HANDOFF.json` exists at the start of a session, a previous session was interrupted (for example by `/compact` or `/gsd:pause-work`) and its state is captured there.

Run `/gsd:resume-work` immediately — before anything else, without waiting for user input. The resume skill will restore context, show project status, and clean up the handoff file.

This instruction is a backup path. When the SessionStart hook fires it emits the same directive via systemMessage; either trigger is sufficient.

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
