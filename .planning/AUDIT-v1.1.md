# v1.1 Session Continuity — Milestone Audit

## Scope

Milestone defined 3 phases (4, 5, 6) covering checkpoint creation, lifecycle, and upstream-compat + docs. Only Phase 4 has been executed. Phases 5 and 6 never started.

Completion snapshot:

| Phase | Status | Artifacts | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 4 — Checkpoint and Resume | **Verified (synthetic + live UAT 1)** | 11 artifacts incl. VERIFICATION.md and HUMAN-UAT.md | All 6 requirements SATISFIED. Live `/compact` round-trip confirmed 2026-04-20 (user ran /compact, HANDOFF.json written, SessionStart auto-resumed). Test 2 (auto-compaction) opportunistic — same code path. |
| 5 — Backup Trigger and Lifecycle | **Not started** | None | 0/5 requirements. |
| 6 — Upstream Compatibility and Documentation | **Not started** | None | 0/6 requirements. |

## Requirements coverage

| Req | Phase | Status | Evidence / gap |
|-----|-------|--------|----------------|
| CKPT-01 | 4 | SATISFIED | PreCompact hook writes HANDOFF.json with all 19 fields (04-VERIFICATION.md §Observable Truths #1, spot check 4). |
| CKPT-02 | 4 | SATISFIED | `uncommitted_files`, `next_action` populated from `git status --porcelain` + STATE.md (spot check 2). |
| CKPT-03 | 4 | SATISFIED | `context_notes` from STATE.md + recent commits; `decisions` extracted from Accumulated Context section. |
| RESM-01 | 4 | SATISFIED | SessionStart hook emits systemMsg pointing to `/gsd:resume-work`. |
| RESM-02 | 4 | SATISFIED | Zero-intervention directive contractually verified AND confirmed live 2026-04-20: manual `/compact` → HANDOFF.json (source=auto-compact) → SessionStart systemMessage → Claude invoked `/gsd:resume-work` with no user prompt (04-HUMAN-UAT.md test 1). |
| RESM-03 | 4 | SATISFIED | systemMsg embeds phase/plan/task from HANDOFF.json. |
| BKUP-01 | 5 | **OPEN** | CLAUDE.md has no HANDOFF.json check instruction. Template `templates/claude-md.md` unchanged. |
| BKUP-02 | 5 | **OPEN** | No hook-independent fallback path. |
| LIFE-01 | 5 | **OPEN** | HANDOFF.json not auto-deleted after resume. `/gsd:resume-work` doesn't clear it. |
| LIFE-02 | 5 | **OPEN** | No staleness threshold check in `bin/lib/checkpoint.cjs`. |
| LIFE-03 | 5 | **Partially covered** | `/gsd:pause-work` + `node bin/gsd-tools.cjs checkpoint --source manual-pause` already exist. No dedicated `/gsd-checkpoint` skill, but the manual trigger mechanism is live. Could be declared SATISFIED depending on strict reading. |
| DOCS-01 | 6 | **OPEN** | README.md has zero mentions of session continuity, HANDOFF, PreCompact, or resume-work. |
| DOCS-02 | 6 | **OPEN** | No CHANGELOG.md exists. Version history lives only in git + GitHub release notes. |
| UPST-01 | 6 | **OPEN** | HANDOFF.json format compat with upstream pause-work never validated. |
| UPST-02 | 6 | Partially met | Plugin version (2.38.1) and upstream version (1.38.1) distinguished in README, PROJECT.md, package.json. No "v1.1 milestone" label visible externally though. |
| UPST-03 | 6 | **OPEN** | Patches not packaged as upstream-ready diffs. |
| UPST-04 | 6 | **OPEN** | No PR to upstream. Quick task 260411-12i drafted a Discussions post only. |

**Score: 6 satisfied + 1 partial + 10 open / 17 total = ~38% complete.**

## Cross-phase integration check

Not applicable — only Phase 4 is implemented. Integration check is deferred until Phase 5 lands checkpoint lifecycle.

## Key findings

1. **The core `/compact` round-trip was never live-tested.** Phase 4 passes all 9 synthetic spot checks, but the pipeline from `executeHooksOutsideREPL → newCustomInstructions` (PreCompact) and `executeHooks → AggregatedHookResult.systemMessage` (SessionStart) is only exercised by a real compaction event. This is the explicit gap flagged in `04-VERIFICATION.md` and `04-HUMAN-UAT.md`. No evidence that a live test has been run in the 9 days since verification.

2. **Phase 5 work is still valuable despite upstream 1.38.x.** Upstream's new features in 1.38.0/1.38.1 (`gsd-read-injection-scanner`, SDK auto-install, `/gsd:ingest-docs`, `/gsd:ultraplan-phase`) are **orthogonal** to session continuity — none of them address HANDOFF lifecycle, CLAUDE.md fallback, or staleness. The plugin's session-continuity surface area is still unique.

3. **Phase 6 partly stale.** UPST-01/03/04 assume the plugin will upstream its session-continuity work. Quick task 260411-12i already drafted a Discussions post (commit 35375e7). Upstream's trajectory (checkpoint primitives added to the SDK in some form during 1.34-1.38.x) may have changed what "upstream-compat" should look like. Deserves a revisit before planning.

4. **DOCS-01 is easy work that never got captured.** README has been updated every sync but still doesn't mention the plugin's session-continuity feature at all. One paragraph would close it.

## Options

**A. Finish v1.1 as planned.** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 5`, then `/gsd:plan-phase 6`. Expect a handful of small mechanical tasks (CLAUDE.md template edit, HANDOFF cleanup in resume-work skill, staleness check, README paragraph, CHANGELOG scaffold) + one harder piece (upstream compat). Estimate: 2–4 hours of focused work.

**B. Ship v1.1 as-is with reduced scope.** Declare Phase 4 "good enough" since synthetic verification is clean, close the live `/compact` UAT gap by running the test now (5 minutes), then cut a v1.1 audit exception: document BKUP/LIFE/DOCS/UPST as deferred-to-v1.2. Fast path to close the milestone.

**C. Re-scope v1.1.** Drop Phase 6 entirely (upstream-compat became murky after upstream added its own primitives), execute a trimmed Phase 5 (BKUP-01 + LIFE-01 only — the two genuinely missing pieces), and ship. LIFE-02 and LIFE-03 are polish; DOCS-01 gets folded into the v1.2 README pass.

## Recommendation

**Option C** is the best fit for where things stand. Rationale:
- BKUP-01 (CLAUDE.md fallback) + LIFE-01 (cleanup after resume) are real gaps with real failure modes. Both are small.
- LIFE-02/03 are speculative lifecycle polish. Defer.
- DOCS-01 can ride along with the next README update pass.
- UPST-* should be rescoped once upstream's own direction is clearer — do not execute in v1.1.

Next concrete step: before planning anything, run the live `/compact` test from `04-HUMAN-UAT.md` test 1. If it passes, Phase 4 closes cleanly. If it fails, Phase 5 gets a new requirement (fix what the live test exposes) before shipping.
