# GSD Performance Optimization via Claude Code Extension Points

## What This Is

A performance-optimized plugin packaging of GSD (Get Shit Done) for Claude Code. Reduces per-turn token overhead by ~92%, exposes project state via MCP tools, and bundles everything into a single-install plugin with cross-session memory.

## Core Value

Reduce GSD's per-turn token overhead and agent spawn latency without breaking multi-CLI compatibility or creating fork maintenance burden.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Research confirms fork is unsustainable (~8-16+ hrs/month) — existing
- ✓ Research confirms most GSD features work fine externally — existing
- ✓ Six integration seams identified in Claude Code — existing
- ✓ `context: 'fork'` added to 15 GSD orchestrator skills — v1.0
- ✓ `.claude/agents/*.md` definitions enhanced for all 18 GSD agent types with typed capabilities — v1.0
- ✓ CLAUDE.md reduced from ~2,338 to ~174 words (~92% reduction) — v1.0
- ✓ GSD MCP server exposes project state as 6 queryable MCP resources — v1.0
- ✓ 10 MCP tools registered for workflow mutations — v1.0
- ✓ MCP server auto-starts via plugin manifest for existing and new projects — v1.0
- ✓ Phase outcomes and key decisions written to Claude Code memdir — v1.0
- ✓ Project context auto-recalled across sessions via memdir pipeline — v1.0
- ✓ GSD packaged as Claude Code plugin (60 skills, 21 agents, MCP, hooks) — v1.0
- ✓ Single-step install via `claude plugin install gsd` — v1.0
- ✓ PreCompact hook saves HANDOFF.json checkpoint via shared `generateCheckpoint`/`writeCheckpoint` library — v1.1 Phase 4
- ✓ SessionStart hook detects HANDOFF.json and injects auto-resume system message (startup/compact only, skips clear/resume) — v1.1 Phase 4
- ✓ CLAUDE.md `## Session Continuity` section provides hook-independent backup trigger — v1.1 Phase 5
- ✓ `/gsd:resume-work` clears HANDOFF.json after successful resume via `deleteCheckpoint()` + `checkpoint --clear` CLI — v1.1 Phase 5
- ✓ Hook commands fall back to newest cached plugin version when baked `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is pruned — v1.1 quick task 260420-vfb
- ✓ Plugin-side `/gsd-<skill>` references normalized to `/gsd:<skill>` with durable maintenance script for post-sync re-runs — v1.1 quick task 260420-cns

### Active (v1.2 Upstream Resilience)

- [ ] File-layout drift detector catches dangling `@~/.claude/...` references before they ship (DRIFT-01, Phase 7)
- [ ] Drift detectors hard-fail in CI on any detected drift (DRIFT-02, Phases 7–9)
- [ ] Committed HANDOFF schema baseline; `checkpoint.cjs` output validates against it in CI (SCHEMA-01/02, Phase 8)
- [ ] Post-upstream-sync check compares upstream `pause-work` output vs plugin's HANDOFF schema (SCHEMA-03, Phase 8)
- [ ] Unified `bin/maintenance/check-drift.cjs` runs file-layout + schema + namespace detectors (DRIFT-03, Phase 9)
- [ ] Full README paragraph documenting session continuity + drift resilience (DOCS-01, Phase 9)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md scaffold tracking plugin vs upstream versions (DOCS-02, Phase 9)
- [ ] PROJECT.md post-sync checklist runs drift check (MAINT-01, Phase 9)

### Active (not yet scoped to a milestone)

- [ ] Add `allowed-tools` to verification skills for read-only enforcement
- [ ] Tool restriction profiles (implementation vs verification vs research)
- [ ] Empirical token measurement before/after (analytical estimates validated during v1.0)

### Out of Scope

- Forking Claude Code — research proved unsustainable for solo maintainer
- Modifying Claude Code source — use public extension points only
- Progress UI integration — requires internal API access, low value vs effort
- Coordinator mode integration — feature-gated, wait for public API
- WorkflowTool registration — feature-gated, wait for public API
- Offline mode — real-time context is core value

## Current State

**Shipped:** v1.1 Session Continuity — 2026-04-20. End-to-end checkpoint-on-compact + auto-resume-on-session-start with CLAUDE.md fallback path and clean handoff lifecycle. Live `/compact` UAT passed. Full v1.1 details: [milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md).

**In progress:** v1.2 Upstream Resilience — kicked off 2026-04-20 (see below).

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Upstream Resilience

**Goal:** Detect and hard-fail on upstream drift before it ships — whether a dangling file reference, a HANDOFF schema change, or namespace slippage. Promotes the ad-hoc drift fixes from v1.1 (hook version fallback, namespace rewrite) into canonical, CI-enforced, detector-backed patterns.

**Why this milestone:** v1.1 closed the session-continuity feature but exposed a meta-problem — the plugin sits downstream of a rapidly-moving upstream (GSD went through 1.34 → 1.38.x during v1.1), and drift was caught ad-hoc by humans noticing bugs. Upstream Resilience makes drift detection a first-class plugin concern: detectors run in CI, hard-fail on drift, and surface the failure at post-sync time rather than after users hit the bug.

**Phases:**
- Phase 7 — File-layout drift detector (DRIFT-01, DRIFT-02)
- Phase 8 — HANDOFF schema baseline + detector (SCHEMA-01/02/03; absorbs reframed v1.1 UPST-01)
- Phase 9 — Unified `check-drift.cjs` + DOCS-01/DOCS-02 + post-sync integration (DRIFT-03, DOCS-01, DOCS-02, MAINT-01)

**Explicitly deferred to v1.3+:** LIFE-02 (staleness detection), LIFE-03 (dedicated checkpoint skill), behavior drift detection (#5 from the drift-category map — needs integration-test infra), UPST-03/04 (upstream PR packaging — still blocked on whether upstream is even the right destination, will be re-evaluated after Phase 8 research into upstream's `pause-work` output).

## Constraints

- **No fork**: Use only public extension points
- **Solo maintainer**: Must be maintainable by one person
- **Multi-CLI compat**: GSD also works with other AI CLIs — improvements should be additive, not breaking
- **Update resilience**: Must survive Claude Code monthly updates
- **Measurable**: Token savings must be quantified before and after

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| No fork | 8-16+ hrs/month maintenance, security risk, solo dev | ✓ Good |
| Extension points only | HIGH stability, no upstream coupling | ✓ Good |
| MCP server over prompt injection | Structured tools > token-heavy context | ✓ Good — 6 resources + 10 tools via @modelcontextprotocol/sdk |
| CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT env var | Plugin path resolution with dev-mode fallback | ✓ Good — clean separation of installed vs development paths |
| Self-contained skills | Embedded workflow content, no execution_context indirection | ✓ Good — zero external file reads at skill load time |
| Lightweight MCP transport | Custom stdio JSON-RPC instead of full SDK in plugin | ✓ Good — reduces dependency footprint |
| memdir project-type memories | Lean phase memories with Why:/How to apply: structure | ✓ Good — auto-recalled by Claude Code's existing pipeline |
| Plugin hooks via hooks/hooks.json | Auto-loaded by plugin loader, not manifest.hooks | ✓ Good — avoids duplicate registration |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? -> Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? -> Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
5. Update `plugins/gsd/` in [davepoon/buildwithclaude](https://github.com/davepoon/buildwithclaude) — bump version, sync agents and skills, update README

**After each upstream GSD sync** (via `/gsd:quick`):
1. Sync `bin/lib/*.cjs` (preserve local patches in core.cjs), `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (preserve local patches), `references/`, `templates/`, `contexts/`
2. Bump version in: `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
3. **Update README.md**: bump "Based on" version line, update skill/agent counts, add/update feature descriptions for new upstream capabilities
4. Update this file's Context section (`Based on [GSD x.y.z]`)
5. Smoke-test: `node -e "require('./bin/lib/core.cjs')"` + verify local patches (resolveGsdRoot, resolveGsdDataDir, resolveGsdAsset)
