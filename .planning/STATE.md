# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Reduce GSD's per-turn token overhead and agent spawn latency without breaking multi-CLI compatibility
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — skill-and-agent-optimization

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (skill-and-agent-optimization) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: No fork -- use only public extension points (HIGH confidence from research)
- [Pre-phase]: MCP server as centerpiece -- structured tools over prompt injection
- [Pre-phase]: Coarse granularity -- 3 phases covering skills/agents, MCP server, plugin/memory
- [Phase 01]: maxTurns tiered at 50/40/30/20 based on agent complexity for optimal context budget allocation
- [Phase 01]: Model resolution stays runtime via gsd-tools (no model: in agent frontmatter) to preserve profile system flexibility
- [Phase 01]: context: fork added to all 15 orchestrator commands; 13 utility commands remain inline to avoid sub-agent spawn overhead

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MCP SDK may have changed since May 2025 -- verify before Phase 2 implementation
- Plugin system stability rated MEDIUM -- check current state before Phase 3
- Token overhead estimates (10x reduction) are analytical, not empirical -- measure during Phase 1
